	<span class='levelOver1 level2'>Ms.</span>
	<span class='levelOver1 level8'>Marvel</span> Until recently,
	<span class='levelOver1 level9'>Jersey</span> City's
	<span class='levelUnknown>Kamala</span> <span class=' levelUnknown>Khan</span>
	didn't think she was special. But one night not too long ago,
	everything changed. 
	<span class='levelUnknown>Kamala</span> was caught in a
<span class='
		levelOver1level5'>mysterious</span>
	<span class='levelOver1 level7'>mist</span>, and when she
	<span class='levelOver1 level3'>recovered</span>, she realized that her
	<span class='levelOver1 level17'>Inhuman</span> powers were suddenly
	<span class='levelOver1 level7'>activated</span>. 
	<span
		class='levelUnknown>Kamala</span> went from being an <span class='
		levelOver1level3'>ordinary</span> high school student to being
	<span class='levelOver1 level2'>Ms.</span>
	<span class='levelOver1 level8'>Marvel</span>â€”a
	<span class='levelOver1 level3'>Super</span>
	<span class='levelOver1 level2'>Hero</span> with the power to
	<span class='levelOver1 level2'>stretch</span>,
	<span class='levelOver1 level15'>morph</span>, and
	<span class='levelOver1 level5'>heal</span>.
