        data-folded="undefined">house.<br>Late-morning sunlight lit the woods. It was almost time for lunch.<br>“Shhh!” said Jack. “What was that noise?”<br>“What noise?”<br>“I heard a noise,” Jack said. He looked around. “It sounded like someone<br>coughing.”<br>“I didn’t hear anything,” said Annie. “Come on. Let’s go up.”<br>She grabbed onto the rope ladder and started climbing.<br>Jack tiptoed over to a clump of bushes. He pushed aside a small branch.<br>“Hello?” he said. “Anybody there?”<br>There was no answer.<br>“Come on!” Annie called down. “The tree house looks the same as it did<br>yesterday.”<br>Jack still felt that someone was nearby. Could it be the person who’d put<br>all the books in the tree house?<br>“Ja-ack!”<br>Jack gazed over the top of the bushes.<br>Was the mysterious person watching him now? The person whose name<br>began with M?<br>Maybe M wanted the gold medallion back. The one Jack had found on<br>their dinosaur adventure. Maybe M wanted the leather bookmark back. The<br>one from the castle book.<br>There was an M on the medallion. And an M on the bookmark. But what<br>did M stand for?<br>“Tomorrow I’ll bring everything back,” Jack said loudly.<br>A breeze swept through the woods. The leaves rattled.<br>“Come on!” called Annie.<br>Jack went back to the big oak tree. He grabbed onto the rope ladder and<br>climbed up.<br>At the top he crawled through a hole in the wooden floor. He tossed down<br>his backpack and pushed his glasses into place.<br>“Hmmm. Which book is it going to be today?” said Annie.<br>She was looking at the books scattered around the tree house.<br>Annie picked up the book about castles.<br>“Hey, this isn’t wet anymore,” she said.<br>“Let me see.”<br>Jack took the book from her. He was amazed. It looked fine. Yesterday it<br>had gotten soaked in a castle moat.<br>The castle book had taken Jack and Annie back to the time of knights.<br>Jack silently thanked the mysterious knight who had rescued them.<br>“Watch out!” warned Annie.<br>She waved a dinosaur book in Jack’s face.<br>“Put that away,” said Jack.<br>The day before yesterday the dinosaur book had taken them to the time of<br>dinosaurs.<br>Jack silently thanked the Pteranodon who had saved him from a<br>Tyrannosaurus rex.<br>Annie put the dinosaur book back with the other books. Then she gasped.<br>“Wow,” she whispered. “Look at this.”<br>She held up a book about ancient Egypt.<br>Jack caught his breath. He took the book from her. A green silk bookmark<br>stuck out of it.<br>Jack turned to the page with the bookmark. There was a picture of a<br>pyramid.<br>Going toward the pyramid was a long parade. Four huge cows with horns<br>were pulling a sled. On the sled was a long gold box. Many Egyptians were<br>walking behind the sled. At the end of the parade was a sleek black cat.<br>“Let’s go there,” whispered Annie. “Now.”<br>“Wait,” said Jack. He wanted to study the book a bit more.<br>“Pyramids, Jack,” said Annie. “You love pyramids.”<br>It was true. Pyramids were high on his list of favorite things. After knights.<br>But before dinosaurs. Way before dinosaurs.<br>He didn’t have to worry about being eaten by a pyramid.<br>“Okay,” he said. “But hold the Pennsylvania book. In case we want to<br>come right back here.”<br>Annie found the book with the picture of their hometown in it. Frog Creek,<br>Pennsylvania.<br>Then Jack pointed to the pyramid picture in the Egypt book. He cleared his<br>throat and said, “I wish we could go to this place.”<br>“Meow!”<br>“What was that?” Jack looked out the tree house window.<br>A black cat was perched on a branch. Right outside the window. The cat<br>was staring at Jack and Annie.<br>It was the strangest cat Jack had ever seen. He was very sleek and dark.<br>With bright yellow eyes. And a wide gold collar.<br>“It’s the cat in the Egypt book,” whispered Annie.<br>Just then the wind started to blow. The leaves began to shake.<br>“Here we go!” cried Annie.<br>The wind whistled louder. The leaves shook harder.<br>Jack closed his eyes as the tree house started to spin.<br>It spun faster and faster! And faster!<br>Suddenly everything was still.<br>Absolutely still.<br>Not a sound. Not a whisper.<br>Jack opened his eyes.<br>Hot bright sunlight nearly blinded him.<br>“Me-ow!”<br>Jack and Annie looked out the window.<br>The tree house was perched on the top of a palm tree. The tree stood with<br>other palm trees. A patch of green surrounded by a sandy desert.<br>“Meow!”<br>Jack and Annie looked down.<br>The black cat was sitting at the base of the tree. His yellow eyes were<br>staring up at Jack and Annie.<br>“Hi!” Annie shouted.<br>“Shhh,” said Jack. “Someone might hear you.”<br>“In the middle of the desert?” said Annie.<br>The black cat stood and began walking around the tree.<br>“Come back!” Annie called. She leaned out the window to see where the<br>cat was going.<br>“Oh, wow!” she said. “Look, Jack.”<br>Jack leaned forward and looked down.<br>The cat was running away from the palm trees. Toward a giant pyramid in<br>the desert.<br>A parade was going toward the pyramid. The same parade as in the Egypt<br>book.<br>“It’s the picture from the book!” said Jack.<br>“What are those people doing?” asked Annie.<br>Jack looked down at the Egypt book. He read the words under the picture:<br>When a royal person died, a grand funeral procession took place. Family,<br>servants, and mourners followed the coffin. The coffin was called a<br>sarcophagus. It was pulled on a sled by four oxen.<br>“It’s an Egyptian funeral,” said Jack. “The box is called a<br>sar … sar … sar … oh, forget it.”<br>He looked out the window again.<br>Oxen, sled, Egyptians, black cat. All were moving in a slow, dreamy way.<br>“I’d better make some notes about this,” said Jack.<br>He reached into his backpack and pulled out his notebook. Jack always<br>kept notes.<br>“Wait,” said Jack. And he wrote:<br>“We’d better hurry,” said Annie, “if we want to see the mummy.”<br>She started down the rope ladder.<br>Jack looked up from his notebook.<br>“Mummy?” he said.<br>“There’s probably a mummy in that gold box,” Annie called up. “We’re in<br>ancient Egypt. Remember?”<br>Jack loved mummies. He put down his pencil.<br>“Good-bye, Jack!” called Annie.<br>“Wait!” Jack called.<br>“Mummies!” Annie shouted.<br>“Oh, man,” said Jack weakly. “Mummies!” She sure knew how to get to<br>him.<br>Jack shoved his notebook and the Egypt book into his pack. Then he<br>started down the ladder.<br>When he got to the ground, he and Annie took off across the sand.<br>But as they ran a strange thing happened.<br>The closer they got to the parade, the harder it was to see it.<br>Then suddenly it was gone. The strange parade had disappeared. Vanished.<br>But the great stone pyramid was still there. Towering above them.<br>Panting, Jack looked around.<br>What had happened? Where were the people? The oxen? The gold box?<br>The cat?<br>“They’re gone,” said Annie.<br>“Where did they go?” said Jack.<br>“Maybe they were ghosts,” said Annie.<br>“Don’t be silly. There’s no such thing as ghosts,” said Jack. “It must have<br>been a mirage.”<br>“A what?”<br>“Mirage. It happens in the desert all the time,” said Jack. “It looks like<br>something’s there. But it just turns out to be the sunlight reflecting through<br>heat.”<br>“How could sunlight look like people, a mummy box, and a bunch of<br>cows?” said Annie.<br>Jack frowned.<br>“Ghosts,” she said.<br>“No way,” said Jack.<br>“Look!” Annie pointed at the pyramid. Near the base was the sleek black<br>cat.<br>He was standing alone. He was staring at Jack and Annie.<br>“He’s no mirage,” said Annie.<br>The cat started to slink away. He walked along the base of the pyramid and<br>slid around a corner.<br>“Where’s he going?” said Jack.<br>“Let’s find out,” said Annie.<br>They dashed around the corner—just in time to see the cat disappear<br>through a hole in the pyramid.<br>“Where did he go?” said Jack.<br>He and Annie peeked through the hole.<br>They saw a long hallway. Burning torches lit the walls. Dark shadows<br>loomed.<br>“Let’s go in,” said Annie.<br>“Wait,” said Jack.<br>He pulled out the Egypt book and turned to the section on pyramids.<br>He read the caption aloud:<br>Pyramids were sometimes called Houses of the Dead. They were nearly all<br>solid stone, except for the burial chambers deep inside.<br>“Wow. Let’s go there. To the burial chambers,” said Annie. “I bet a<br>mummy’s there.”<br>Jack took a deep breath.<br>Then he stepped out of the hot, bright sunlight into the cool, dark pyramid.<br>The hallway was silent.<br>Floor, ceiling, walls—everything was stone.<br>The floor slanted up from where they stood.<br>“We have to go farther inside,” said Annie.<br>“Right,” said Jack. “But stay close behind me. Don’t talk. Don’t—”<br>“Go! Just go!” said Annie. She gave him a little push.<br>Jack started up the slanting floor of the hallway.<br>Where was the cat?<br>The hallway went on and on.<br>“Wait,” said Jack. “I want to look at the book.”<br>He opened the Egypt book again. He held it below a torch on the wall. The<br>book showed a picture of the inside of the pyramid.<br>“The burial chamber is in the middle of the pyramid. See?” Jack said. He<br>pointed to the picture. “It seems to be straight ahead.”<br>Jack tucked the book under his arm. Then they headed deeper into the<br>pyramid.<br>Soon the floor became flat. The air felt different. Musty and stale.<br>Jack opened the book again. “I think we’re almost at the burial chamber.<br>See the picture? The hallway slants up. Then it gets flat. Then you come to<br>the chamber. See, look—”<br>“Eee-eee!” A strange cry shot through the pyramid.<br>Jack dropped the Egypt book.<br>Out of the shadows flew a white figure.<br>It swooshed toward them!<br>A mummy!<br>“It’s alive!” Annie shouted.<br><br>Jack pulled Annie down.<br>The white figure moved swiftly past them. Then disappeared into the<br>shadows.<br>“A mummy,” said Annie. “Back from the dead!”<br>“F-forget it,” stammered Jack. “Mummies aren’t alive.” He picked up the<br>Egypt book.<br>“What’s this?” said Annie. She lifted something from the floor. “Look.<br>The mummy dropped this thing.”<br>It was a gold stick. About a foot long. A dog’s head was carved on one<br>end.<br>“It looks like a scepter,” said Jack.<br>“What’s that?” asked Annie.<br>“It’s a thing kings and queens carry,” said Jack. “It means they have power<br>over the people.”<br>“Come back, mummy!” Annie called. “We found your scepter. Come<br>back! We want to help you!”<br>“Shush!” said Jack. “Are you nuts?”<br>“But the mummy—”<br>“That was no mummy,” said Jack. “It was a person. A real person.”<br>“What kind of person would be inside a pyramid?” asked Annie.<br>“I don’t know,” said Jack. “Maybe the book can help us.”<br>He flipped through the book. At last he found a picture of a person in a<br>pyramid. He read:<br>Tomb robbers often carried off the treasure buried with mummies. False<br>passages were sometimes built to stop the robbers.<br>Jack closed the book.<br>“No live mummy,” he said. “Just a tomb robber.”<br>“Yikes. A tomb robber?” said Annie.<br>“Yeah, a robber who steals stuff from tombs.”<br>“But what if the robber comes back,” said Annie. “We’d better leave.”<br>“Right,” said Jack. “But first I want to write something down.”<br>He put the Egypt book into his pack. He pulled out his notebook and<br>pencil.<br>He started writing in his notebook:<br>“Jack—” said Annie.<br>“Just a second,” said Jack. He kept writing:<br>“Jack! Look!” said Annie.<br>Jack felt a whoosh of cold air. He looked up. A wave of terror went<br>through him.<br>Another figure was moving slowly toward them.<br>It wasn’t a tomb robber.<br>No. It was a lady. A beautiful Egyptian lady.<br>She wore flowers in her black hair. Her long white dress had many tiny<br>pleats. Her gold jewelry glittered.<br>“Here, Jack,” Annie whispered. “Give her this.” She handed him the gold<br>scepter.<br>The lady stopped in front of them.<br>Jack held out the scepter. His hand was trembling.<br>He gasped. The scepter passed right through the lady’s hand.<br>She was made of air.<br>“A ghost,” Annie whispered.<br>But Jack could only stare in horror.<br>The ghost began to speak. She spoke in a hollow, echoing voice.<br>“I am Hutepi,” she said. “Queen of the Nile. Is it true that you have come<br>to help me?”<br>“Yes,” said Annie.<br>Jack still couldn’t speak.<br>“For a thousand years,” said the ghost-queen, “I have waited for help.”<br>Jack’s heart was pounding so hard he thought he might faint.<br>“Someone must find my Book of the Dead,” she said. “I need it to go on to<br>the Next Life.”<br>“Why do you need the Book of the Dead?” asked Annie. She didn’t sound<br>scared at all.<br>“It will tell me the magic spells I need to get through the Underworld,”<br>said the ghost-queen.<br>“The Underworld?” said Annie.<br>“Before I journey on to the Next Life, I must pass through the horrors of<br>the Underworld.”<br>“What kinds of horrors?” Annie asked.<br>“Poisonous snakes,” said the ghost-queen. “Lakes of fire. Monsters.<br>Demons.”<br>“Oh.” Annie stepped closer to Jack.<br>“My brother hid the Book of the Dead. So tomb robbers would not steal<br>it,” said the ghost-queen. “Then he carved this secret message on the wall,<br>telling me how to find it.”<br>She pointed to the wall.<br>Jack was still in shock. He couldn’t move.<br>“Where?” asked Annie. “Here?” She squinted at the wall. “What do these<br>tiny pictures mean?”<br>The ghost-queen smiled sadly. “Alas, my brother forgot my strange<br>problem. I cannot see clearly that which is close to my eyes. I have not been<br>able to read his message for a thousand years.”<br>“Oh, that’s not a strange problem,” said Annie. “Jack can’t see anything<br>either. That’s why he wears glasses.”<br>The ghost-queen stared in wonder at Jack.<br>“Jack, lend her your glasses,” said Annie.<br>Jack took his glasses off his nose. He held them out to the ghost-queen.<br>She backed away from him. “I fear I cannot wear your glasses, Jack,” she<br>said. “I am made of air.”<br>“Oh. I forgot,” said Annie.<br>“But perhaps you will describe the hieroglyphs on these walls,” said the<br>ghost-queen.<br>“Hi-row-who?” said Annie.<br>“Hieroglyphs!” said Jack, finally finding his voice. “It’s the ancient<br>Egyptian way of writing. It’s like writing with pictures.”<br>The ghost-queen smiled at him. “Thank you, Jack,” she said.<br>Jack smiled back at her. He put his glasses on. Then he stepped toward the<br>wall and took a good long look.<br>“Oh, man,” he whispered.<br><br>Jack and Annie squinted at the pyramid wall.<br>A series of tiny pictures were carved into the stone.<br>“There are four pictures here,” Jack told the ghost-queen.<br>“Describe them to me, Jack. One at a time, please,” she said.<br>Jack studied the first picture.<br>“Okay,” he said. “The first one is like this.” He made a zigzag in the air<br>with his finger.<br>“Like stairs?” asked the ghost-queen.<br>“Yes, stairs!” said Jack. “Just like stairs.”<br>She nodded.<br>Easy enough.<br>Jack studied the second picture.<br>“The second one has a long box on the bottom,” he said. He drew it in the<br>air.<br>The ghost-queen looked puzzled.<br>“With three things on top. Like this,” said Annie. She drew squiggly lines<br>in the air.<br>The ghost-queen still seemed puzzled.<br>“Like a hat,” said Jack.<br>“Hat?” said the ghost-queen.<br>“No. More like a boat,” said Annie.<br>“Boat?” said the ghost-queen. She got excited. “Boat?”<br>Jack took another look at the wall.<br>“Yes. It could be a boat,” he said.<br>The ghost-queen looked very happy. She smiled.<br>“Yes. Of course,” she said.<br>Jack and Annie studied the next picture.<br>“The third one is like a thing that holds flowers,” said Annie.<br>“Or a thing that holds water,” said Jack.<br>“Like a jug?” asked the ghost-queen.<br>“Exactly,” said Jack.<br>“Yes. A jug,” said Annie.<br>Jack and Annie studied the last picture.<br>“And the last one looks like a pole that droops,” said Annie.<br>“Like a curved stick,” said Jack. “But one side is shorter than the other.”<br>The ghost-queen looked puzzled.<br>“Wait,” said Jack. “I’ll draw it in my notebook. Big! So you can see it.”<br>Jack put down the scepter and got out his pencil. He drew the hieroglyph.<br>“A folded cloth,” said the ghost-queen.<br>“Well, not really,” said Jack. He studied his drawing.<br>“But that is the hieroglyph for a folded cloth,” said the ghost-queen.<br>“Well, okay,” said Jack.<br>He looked at the fourth hieroglyph again. He still couldn’t see the folded<br>cloth. Unless it was like a towel hanging over a bathroom rod.<br>“So that’s all of them,” said Annie. She pointed at each picture. “Stairs.<br>Boat. Jug. Folded cloth.”<br>Jack wrote the words in his notebook.<br>“So what does the message mean?” he asked the ghost-queen.<br>“Come,” she said. She held out her hand.<br>“Come to my burial chambers.”<br>And she floated away.<br>Jack put the scepter and his notebook and pencil into his pack.<br>He and Annie followed the ghost-queen. Deeper into the pyramid. Until<br>they came to some stairs.<br>“The STAIRS!” said Jack and Annie.<br>The ghost-queen floated up the stairs.<br>Jack and Annie followed.<br>The ghost-queen floated right through a wooden door.<br>Jack and Annie pushed on the door. It opened slowly.<br>They stepped into a cold, drafty room.<br>The ghost-queen was nowhere in sight.<br>Dim torchlight lit the huge room. It had a very high ceiling. On one side<br>was a pile of tables, chairs, and musical instruments.<br>On the other side of the room was a small wooden boat.<br>“The BOAT!” said Jack.<br>“What’s it doing inside Queen Hutepi’s pyramid?” asked Annie.<br>“Maybe it’s supposed to carry her to the Next Life,” said Jack.<br>He and Annie went over to the boat. They looked inside it.<br>The boat was filled with many things. Gold plates. Painted cups. Jeweled<br>goblets. Woven baskets. Jewelry with blue stones. Small wooden statues.<br>“Look!” said Jack.<br>He reached into the boat and lifted out a clay jug.<br>“The JUG!” said Annie.<br>Jack looked inside the jug.<br>“Something’s in here,” he said.<br>“What is it?” asked Annie.<br>Jack felt down inside the jug.<br>“It feels like a big napkin,” he said.<br>“The FOLDED CLOTH!” said Annie.<br>Jack reached into the jug and pulled out the folded cloth. It was wrapped<br>around an ancient-looking scroll.<br>Jack slowly unrolled the scroll.<br>It was covered with wonderful hieroglyphs.<br>“The Book of the Dead!” whispered Annie. “We found it. We found her<br>book.”<br>“Oh, man.” Jack traced his finger over the scroll. It felt like very old paper.<br>“Queen Hutepi!” called Annie. “We have it! We found your Book of the<br>Dead!”<br>Silence.<br>“Queen Hutepi!”<br>Then another door on the other side of the chamber creaked open.<br>“In there,” said Annie. “Maybe she’s in there.”<br>Jack’s heart was pounding. Cold air was coming through the open<br>doorway.<br>“Come on,” said Annie.<br>“Wait—”<br>“No,” said Annie. “She’s waited a thousand years for her book. Don’t<br>make her wait anymore.”<br>Jack put the ancient scroll into his backpack. Then he and Annie slowly<br>started to cross the drafty room.<br>They came to the open door. Annie went through first.<br>“Hurry, Jack!” she said.<br>Jack stepped into the other room.<br>It was nearly bare. Except for a long gold box. The box was open. The<br>cover was on the floor.<br>“Queen Hutepi?” called Annie.<br>Silence.<br>“We found it,” said Annie. “Your Book of the Dead.”<br>There was still no sign of the ghost-queen.<br>The gold box glowed.<br>Jack could barely breathe. “Let’s leave the scroll on the floor. And go,” he<br>said.<br>“No. I think we should leave it in there,” said Annie. She pointed to the<br>gold box.<br>“No,” said Jack.<br>“Don’t be afraid,” said Annie. “Come on.”<br>Annie took Jack by the arm. They walked together. Across the room. To<br>the glowing gold box.<br>They stopped in front of the box. And they peered inside.<br>A real mummy.<br>Bandages were still wrapped around the bald skull. But most of the<br>bandages had come off the face.<br>It was Hutepi. Queen of the Nile.<br>Her broken teeth were showing. Her little wrinkled ears. Her squashed<br>nose. Her withered flesh. Her hollow eye sockets.<br>Plus the rotting bandages on her body were coming off. You could see<br>bones.<br>“Oh, gross!” cried Annie. “Let’s go!”<br>“No,” said Jack. “It’s interesting.”<br>“Forget it!” said Annie. She started out of the room.<br>“Wait, Annie.”<br>“Come on, Jack. Hurry!” cried Annie. She was standing by the door.<br>Jack pulled out the Egypt book and flipped to a picture of a mummy. He<br>read aloud:<br>Ancient Egyptians tried to protect the body so it would last forever. First it<br>was dried out with salt.<br>“Ugh, stop!” said Annie.<br>“Listen,” said Jack. He kept reading:<br>Next it was covered with oil. Then it was wrapped tightly in bandages. The<br>brain was removed by—<br>“Yuck! Stop!” cried Annie. “Good-bye!” She dashed out of the room.<br>“Annie!” called Jack. “We have to give her the Book of the Dead!”<br>But Annie was gone.<br>Jack reached into his pack. He pulled out the scroll and the scepter. He put<br>them next to the mummy’s skull.<br>Was it just his imagination? Or did a deep sigh seem to shudder throughout<br>the room? Did the mummy’s face grow calmer?<br>Jack held his breath as he backed away. Out of the mummy room. Out of<br>the boat room. Down the stairs.<br>At the bottom of the stairs, he heaved his own sigh. A sigh of relief.<br>He looked down the hallway. It was empty.<br>“Hey! Where are you?” he said.<br>No answer.<br>Where in the world was Annie?<br>Jack started down the hallway.<br>“Annie!” he called.<br>Had she run out of the pyramid? Was she already outside?<br>“Annie!”<br>“Help, Jack!” came a cry. The voice sounded far away.<br>It was Annie! Where was she?<br>“Help, Jack!”<br>“Annie!”<br>Jack started to run. Along the shadowy hallway.<br>“Help, Jack!” Her cry seemed fainter.<br>Jack stopped.<br>He was running away from her voice.<br>“Annie!” he called. He went back toward the burial chambers.<br>“Jack!”<br>There! Her voice was louder.<br>“Jack!”<br>Even louder!<br>Jack climbed the stairs. He went back into the boat room.<br>He looked around the room. At the furniture. The musical instruments. The<br>boat.<br>Then he saw it. Another door! Right next to the door he had just come<br>through.<br>The other door was open.<br>Jack dashed through it. He found himself at the top of some stairs.<br>They were just like the stairs in the other hallway.<br>He went down into the hallway. It was lit by torches on the wall.<br>It was just like the other hallway.<br>“Annie!” he called.<br>“Jack!”<br>“Annie!”<br>“Jack!”<br>She was running through the hallway toward him.<br>She crashed into him.<br>“I was lost!” she cried.<br>“I think this is one of those false passages. Built to fool the tomb robbers,”<br>said Jack.<br>“A false passage?” said Annie, panting.<br>“Yeah, it looks just like the right hallway,” said Jack. “We have to go back<br>into the boat room. And out the right door.”<br>Just then they heard a creaking noise.<br>Jack and Annie turned around. They looked up the stairs.<br>Then they watched in horror as the door slowly creaked shut.<br>A deep sound rumbled in the distance. And all the torches went out.<br>It was pitch dark.<br>“What happened?” asked Annie.<br>“I don’t know. Something weird,” said Jack. “We have to get out of here<br>fast. Push against the door.”<br>“Good idea,” said Annie in a small voice.<br>They felt their way through the darkness. To the top of the stairs.<br>“Don’t worry. Everything’s going to be okay,” said Jack. He was trying to<br>stay calm.<br>“Of course,” said Annie.<br>They leaned against the wooden door and pushed.<br>It wouldn’t budge.<br>They pushed harder.<br>No use.<br>Jack took a deep breath. It was getting harder to breathe. And harder to<br>stay calm.<br>“What can we do?” asked Annie.<br>“Just … just rest a moment,” said Jack, panting.<br>His heart was pounding as he tried to see through the darkness.<br>“Maybe we should start down the hall,” he said. “Maybe we’ll eventually<br>come to … to an exit.”<br>He wasn’t sure about that. But they had no choice.<br>“Come on,” he said. “Feel the wall.”<br>Jack felt the stone wall as he climbed slowly down the stairs. Annie<br>followed.<br>Jack started down the dark hallway. It was impossible to see anything.<br>But he kept going. Taking one step at a time. Moving his hands along the<br>wall.<br>He went around a corner. He went around another corner. He came to<br>some stairs. He went up.<br>There was a door. He pushed against it. Annie pushed, too. This door<br>wouldn’t budge either.<br>Was this the same door they had started at?<br>It was no use. They were trapped.<br>Annie took his hand in the dark. She squeezed it.<br>They stood together at the top of the stairs. Listening to the silence.<br>“Meow.”<br>“Oh, man,” Jack whispered.<br>“He’s back!” said Annie.<br>“Meow.”<br>“Follow him!” cried Jack. “He’s going away from us.”<br>They started down the dark hallway. Following the cat’s meow.<br>Hands against the wall, Jack and Annie stumbled through the darkness.<br>“Meow.”<br>They followed the sound. All the way through the winding hallway. Down,<br>down, down.<br>Around one corner, then another. And another …<br>Finally they saw a light at the end of the tunnel. They rushed forward—out<br>into the bright sunlight.<br>“Yay!” Annie shouted.<br>But Jack was thinking.<br>“Annie,” he said. “How did we get out of the false passage?”<br>“The cat,” said Annie.<br>“But how could the cat do it?” asked Jack.<br>“Magic,” said Annie.<br>Jack frowned. “But—”<br>“Look!” said Annie. She pointed.<br>The cat was bounding away. Over the sand.<br>“Thank you!” called Annie.<br>“Thanks!” Jack shouted at the cat.<br>His black tail waved.<br>Then he disappeared in the shimmering waves of heat.<br>Jack looked toward the palm trees. At the top of one sat the tree house.<br>Like a bird’s nest.<br>“Time to go home,” Jack said.<br>He and Annie set off for the palm trees. It was a long hot walk back.<br>At last Annie grabbed onto the rope ladder. Then Jack.<br>Once they were inside the tree house, Jack reached for the book about<br>Pennsylvania.<br>Just then he heard a rumbling sound. The same sound they had heard in the<br>pyramid.<br>“Look!” Annie said, pointing out the window.<br>Jack looked.<br>A boat was beside the pyramid. It was gliding over the sand. Like a boat<br>sailing over the sea.<br>Then it faded away. Into the distance.<br>Was it just a mirage?<br>Or was the ghost-queen finally on her way to the Next Life?<br>“Home, Jack,” whispered Annie.<br>Jack opened the Pennsylvania book.<br>He pointed to the picture of Frog Creek.<br>“I wish we could go home,” he said.<br>The wind began to blow.<br>The leaves began to shake.<br>The wind blew harder. It whistled louder.<br>The tree house started to spin.<br>It spun faster and faster.<br>Then everything was still.<br>Absolutely silent.<br>Late-morning sunlight shone through the tree house window. Shadows<br>danced on the walls and ceiling.<br>Jack took a deep breath. He was lying on the floor of the tree house.<br>“I wonder what Mom’s making for lunch,” said Annie. She was looking<br>out the window.<br>Jack smiled. Lunch. Mom. Home. It all sounded so real. So calm and safe.<br>“I hope it’s peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,” he said.<br>He closed his eyes. The wood floor felt cool.<br>“Boy, this place is a mess,” said Annie. “We’d better make it neater. In<br>case M comes back.”<br>Jack had almost forgotten about M.<br>Would they ever meet the mysterious M? The person who seemed to own<br>all the books in the tree house?<br>“Let’s put the Egypt book on the bottom of the pile,” said Annie.<br>“Good idea,” said Jack. He needed a rest before he visited any more<br>ancient tombs.<br>“Let’s put the dinosaur book on top of the Egypt book,” said Annie.<br>“Yeah, good,” said Jack. And a long rest before he visited another<br>Tyrannosaurus rex.<br>“The castle book can go on the very top of the pile,” said Annie.<br>Jack nodded and smiled. He liked thinking about the knight on the cover of<br>the castle book. He felt as if the knight were his friend.<br>“Jack,” said Annie. “Look!”<br>Jack opened his eyes. She was pointing at the wooden floor.<br>“What is it?” he asked.<br>“You have to see for yourself.”<br>Jack groaned as he got up. He stood next to Annie and looked at the floor.<br>He didn’t see anything.<br>“Turn your head a little,” said Annie. “You have to catch the light just<br>right.”<br>Jack tipped his head to one side. Something was shining on the floor.<br>He tipped his head a bit more. A letter came into focus.<br>The letter M! It shimmered in the sunlight.<br>This proved the tree house belonged to M.<br>Absolutely for sure. No question. No doubt about it.<br>Jack touched the M with his finger. His skin tingled.<br>Just then the leaves trembled. The wind picked up.<br>“Let’s go down now,” he said.<br>Jack grabbed his backpack. Then he and Annie climbed down the ladder.<br>As they stood on the ground below the tree house, Jack heard a sound in<br>the bushes.<br>“Who’s there?” he called.<br>The woods grew still.<br>“I’m going to bring the medallion back soon,” Jack said loudly. “And the<br>bookmark, too. Both of them. Tomorrow!”<br>“Who are you talking to?” asked Annie.<br>“I feel like M is nearby,” Jack whispered.<br>Annie’s eyes grew wide. “Should we look for him?”<br>But just then their mother’s voice came from the distance. “Ja-ack! Annie!”<br>Jack and Annie looked around at the trees. Then they looked at each other.<br>“Tomorrow,” they said together.<br>And they took off, running out of the woods.<br>They ran down their street.<br>They ran across their yard.<br>They ran into their house.<br>They ran into their kitchen.<br>They ran right into their mom.<br>She was making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.<br>Here’s a special preview of<br>Magic Tree House #4<br>Pirates Past Noon<br>Available now!<br>Excerpt copyright © 1994 by<br>Published by Random House Children’s Books,<br>a division of Random House, Inc., New York.<br>Jack stared out his bedroom window. The rain kept falling. And falling.<br>“The TV said it would stop by noon,” said Annie, his seven-year-old sister.<br>“It’s already past noon,” said Jack.<br>“But we have to go to the tree house,” said Annie. “I have a feeling the M<br>person will be there today.”<br>Jack pushed his glasses into place and took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure<br>he was ready to meet the M person yet. The mysterious person who had put<br>all the books in the magic tree house.<br>“Come on,” said Annie.<br>Jack sighed. “Okay,” he said. “You get our raincoats and boots. I’ll get the<br>medallion and bookmark.”<br>Annie ran to get their rain gear.<br>Jack reached into his drawer. He took out the medallion.<br>It was gold. The letter M was engraved on it.<br>Then he took out the bookmark. It was made of blue leather. It had the<br>same M on it.<br>Both M’s matched the M that was on the floor of the tree house.<br>Jack put the medallion and bookmark into his backpack. Then he threw in<br>his notebook and pencil. Jack liked to take notes about important things.<br>“I got our rain stuff!” called Annie.<br>Jack picked up his pack and went downstairs. Annie was waiting by the<br>back door. She was putting on her boots. “Meet you outside,” she said.<br>Jack pulled on his raincoat and boots. Then he put on his backpack and<br>joined her.<br>The wind was blowing hard.<br>“Ready! Set! Go!” shouted Annie.<br>They kept their heads down and charged into the rainy wind.<br>Soon they were in the Frog Creek woods.<br>Tree branches swayed, flinging rainwater everywhere.<br>“Yuck!” said Annie.<br>They splashed through puddles. Until they came to the tallest oak tree in<br>the woods.<br>They looked up.<br>Tucked between two branches was the tree house. It looked dark and<br>lonely against the stormy sky.<br>Hanging from the tree house was a rope ladder. It was blowing in the wind.<br>Jack thought of all the books up there. He hoped they weren’t getting wet.<br>“The M person’s been there,” said Annie.<br>Jack caught his breath. “How can you tell?” he said.<br>“I can feel it,” she whispered.<br>She grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.<br>Inside the tree house it was chilly and damp.<br>But the books were dry. They were all neatly stacked along the wall. Just<br>the way they had been the day before.<br>Annie picked up a castle book on top of one stack. It had taken them to the<br>time of castles.<br>“Remember the knight?” she said.<br>Jack nodded. He would never forget the knight who had helped them.<br>Annie put down the castle book. She picked up the next book on the stack.<br>It was the dinosaur book that had taken them to the time of dinosaurs.<br>“Remember?” she said.<br>Jack nodded.<br>He’d never forget the pteranodon who had saved him from the<br>Tyrannosaurus rex.<br>Then Annie held up a book about ancient Egypt.<br>“Meow,” she said.<br>Jack smiled. The Egypt book had taken them to the time of pyramids. A<br>black cat had come to the rescue there.<br>“And here’s the book about home,” Annie said.<br>She held up the book with the picture of their hometown in it.<br>Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.<br>Jack smiled again. The Pennsylvania book had brought them back home at<br>the end of each of their adventures.<br>Jack sighed. Okay. He still had two main questions.<br>Who was the M person who had put all the books here?<br>And did the knight, the pteranodon, and the cat all know the M person?<br>Finally Jack reached into his backpack. He took out the gold medallion and<br>the leather bookmark. He placed them on the floor. Right over the spot where<br>the M glowed faintly in the wood.<br>Rain blew into the tree house.<br>“Brr!” said Annie. “It’s not very cozy today.”<br>Jack agreed with her. It was too wet and cold.<br>“Look.” Annie pointed to an open book lying in the corner. “I don’t<br>remember a book being open.”<br>“Me neither,” said Jack.<br>Annie picked up the book. She stared at the picture on the page.<br>“Wow, this place looks great.” She showed the picture to Jack.<br>He saw a sunny beach. A big green parrot sitting in a palm tree. And a ship<br>sailing on a blue sea.<br>Another gust of rainy wind blew into the tree house.<br>Annie pointed to the picture. “I wish we were there instead of here,” she<br>said.<br>“Yeah,” said Jack. “But where is there?”<br>“Too late!” came a squawk.<br>Jack and Annie turned quickly.<br>Sitting on a branch outside the window ledge of the tree house was a green<br>parrot. Exactly like the parrot in the picture.<br>“Too late!” the parrot squawked again.<br>“A talking parrot!” said Annie. “Is your name Polly? Can I call you<br>Polly?”<br>Suddenly the wind started to whistle.<br>“Oh no! Now we’re in big trouble!” said Jack.<br>The wind blew harder.<br>The leaves shook.<br>The tree house started to spin. Faster and faster!<br>Jack squeezed his eyes shut. Then everything was still.<br>Absolutely still.<br>Jack opened his eyes.<br>“Too late!” squawked Polly.</pre>
